- 👋 Hey there! I'm Hemavathi — a developer who blends creativity with code.  
💻 I work across the full MERN stack, turning ideas into intuitive and scalable web apps.  
🤖 I'm deeply curious about AI and how intelligent systems can enhance real-world experiences.  
🌱 Constantly evolving — whether it's learning new frameworks, exploring machine learning, or refining backend logic.  
👯 I'm always open to collaborating on impactful projects that challenge conventions and spark innovation.  
♟️ When I’m not building or learning, you’ll find me solving puzzles, playing chess, or decoding riddles.  
🎯 My goal? To craft technology that not only works — but feels human.
